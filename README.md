## Hello ! 👋

I'm a student of Universitas Komputer Indonesia majoring in Informatics Engineering. I realize I have a passion for computer science, so I started to explore technology since I was in elementary school and when I'm in senior high school I decide to take computer science for my collage. I’m a nice fun and friendly person, I’m honest and punctual, I work well in a team but also on my own as I like to set myself goals which I will achieve, I have good listening and communication skills. I have a creative mind and am always up for new challenges. I am well organized and always plan ahead to make sure I manage my time well.
