## Hello ! 👋

I am a student of Universitas Komputer Indonesia, majoring in Computer Science. I understand I have a passion for Computer Science, so I began to explore and discover technology since I was sitting in elementary school. When I\`m in senior high school, I decide to take Computer Science for my university. Moreover, now I\`m delighted in Computer Science, I\`m continuously impressed with the technology that has been created, and I wish I can make innovation for a better future. I focused on web development, especially on the front-end side.
